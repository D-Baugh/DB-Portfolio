## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1

⚙️ This week I've worked on getting my environment setup, completing all assignments on time, and I began styling the page.
<br>
🌵 My biggest challenge was the CSS. Something about CS just makes it come slower to me than HTML or backend languages like Javascript. I really have to push myyself in this area if I am going to succeed. Remembering the subtle nuances of gap, padding, margin, border, and how they all tie in together is one particular challenge. Flexbox is easy enough for the moment, but needs further review. Grid is more of a challenge, another area I need to push myself in. There are others but these mentions will be my focal starting point to improving my CSS game.  
<br>
🏆 I feel like I've leveled up on learning git hub. I've always wanted to understand the platform more intimately and this week was a great start to understanding the functions and some of the nuances to the site. I really improved overall this week. I was not just working on an assignment. I was having fun sharpening my coding metal. I really felt it all come together and I am excited to continue progress on the site.
<br>
🔮 I want to continue striking while the iron is hot. So my next priority is to beef up the CSS further and really dig in. Gain a better comprehension of flexbox, grid, gap, padding, margin, border, and the many ways I can style them.

### Week 2

⚙️ Overview - I completed remaining CSS for readysettravel homepage. Had enough time to knockout a very basic prototype for each of the subpages.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - I used a grid with a second overlapping grid to create the Top Notch Destinations section, this came with some serious challenges. The initial creation of the first grid was easy enough, but I struggled when it came time to overlap text for each image. I spent around 6+ hours trying to perfect the placement and sizing. I learned a lot though, and will strive to create similar stylings to retain and improve my grid skills.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - Major level ups on my css game this week. Particularly styling images, grids, and flexbox.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - I want continue my progress in improving my css skills. When I go to style my prototype pages I want to not only use it as an opportunity for repititious practice but to also take some of the elements I did in the homepage and layer them further with more styles.

### Week 3

⚙️ Overview - I focused on the initial html for each page, added footer & headers, and did some minor styling
<br>
🌵 Challenges - One concern I have is trying to implement the stars in the review cards for the about us page. Mostly implementing it without running into parse errors during validation.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - The scope of this project really put into perspective some key principles for me. The biggest is planning out your projects, having the blueprint from week 2 was super useful. The second is reusing code when possible and editing it as necessary for the task at hand to save as much time as possible and commit more time to fine tuning important details.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - Next is completing CSS for each page, to do this I need to prioritize quick efficient solutions to my styling task. Keep each page unique but not so detailed that I lose too much time and can't complete the project as a whole.

### Week 4

⚙️ Overview - I was able to complete the remaining CSS on all secondary pages.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - I ran into difficulty styling images within grids, but I was able to overcome and grow more efficient than ever.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I leveled up not only in CSS and HTML skills, but my skills as a developer. With each page I styled, I progressively became quicker, had better design choices, and was more concise. I acknowledged flaws in my design patterns and semantic choices. I reflected on them and am confident that my coding in my next project will be more precise and clean. If I had one regret this month, it was not incorporating JS to create some cool graphics. I had an idea to make all the cards on the tour page have a special affect when hovered over with a user's cursor but ran out of time.  
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - I want to next focus on my JS skills, growing them in the same amount I grew my HTML and CSS this month.
