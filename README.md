Greetings! I am a Frontend Web Developer from San Diego, California currently attending Full Sail University for my BA in computer science with a major in Frontend Web Development. The purpose of this repository is to display various projects, both personal and assigned during my Full Sail tenure.
<br>

Please navigate to the 'dev' folder for all currently completed and ongoing projects.
<br>

The 'docs' folder contains various information for each project such as weekly stand-ups, changelogs, and proof of validation.
