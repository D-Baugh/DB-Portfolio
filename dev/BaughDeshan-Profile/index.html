        <p id="about-me-P" class="lato-regular">I am your friendly simple developer with an affinity for all things tech. The first time I touched a computer I was about six years. Immediately a spell was cast over me. I had to be pulled away from the family desktop at odd hours. I grew up on simple PC games such as pinball and marbles at first, then more complex games came. My first fully developed game I played was Starcraft by Blizzard Entertainment, from that moment on I knew I wanted a career in computer science. After much trial and error finding my place in the ocean of computer science, I found web development as my passion. </p>
